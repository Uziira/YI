  <div class="content">
    <p>You might wonder <span class="highlight">how we met</span>, a random guy from Paris and a random girl from Hangzhou.</p>
    <p>That's a good question.</p>
    <p>Our first interaction began on August 18, 2025, on Hello Talk. She was the one who made the first move. Curious about my style and appearance, she couldn't help but talk to me to satisfy her curiosity.</p>
    <p>That day I met a girl who was so kind that I wondered how someone like her could exist in this world.</p>
    <p>We quickly found things in common, but above all Spanish music.</p>
    <p>I had just sprained my ankle, making it impossible for me to walk or enjoy my vacation. To be honest, I was depressed. But the arrival of this girl in my life changed everything.</p>
    <p>And that is how our story began.</p>
