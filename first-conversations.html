  <h1>💬 First Conversations</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>As mentioned earlier, we immediately found several things in common.</p>
    <p>Even though we didn't really know each other, we <span class="highlight">talked every day</span>. Not a single day went by without us talking.</p>
    <p>And very quickly, we were talking all day long, sharing our days, our emotions, our school life, our plans for the future. Our romantic ambitions: that of falling in love and staying with that person for life, not just a few months.</p>
    <p>When I say we talked all the time, I mean all the time. We talked so much that after a few weeks, it felt like we had known each other for years.</p>
    <p>Even though we had just met, 9,304 km apart, never seen each other, never spoken on the phone, our conversations gave the impression that this was not the case.</p>
    <p>Ask around to see if there are people who have such a strong connection with someone 10,000 kilometers away. No one will tell you that they have a better connection than us in such a short time.</p>
    <p>That's when something deep inside me was born. Something I hadn't anticipated at all, something that had left my body many years ago, something I thought could no longer exist within me.</p>
    <p>Romantic feelings. But of course, I didn't have the courage to express them out loud, so I did my best to make it clear through my actions and words, the way I talked to her, the way I showed interest in her.</p>
    <p>And then that famous day arrived.</p>
